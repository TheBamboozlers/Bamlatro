Idea on Spectrals:
	[ ] Name the bamboozle card to "Tap the Glass" (picture of tyler in art).

Idea on Vouchers:
	
	[ Expand to all decks ] Shop always has 2 vouchers?
		
		If so, first shop of game has special voucher that increases Bamlatro jokers appearance in shop.

Joker:
	[ ] Whenever you use a planet card in-round, destroy up to two selected cards in hand.

	[ ] When you play a 4 or a 5 of a kind, gain an Emperor.

	[ ] TINKERS CONSTRUCT: Gold cards give 1.25x mult when in hand. Steel cards give $2 when in hand.

	[ Done ] While holding this card, gain 2 joker slots. 0.5X mult. (maybe money drawback instead?)	

	[ ] PROP HUNT: When numbered cards are scored, 1 in 2 chance to convert to Jack. When Jacks are scored, 1 in 2 chance to convert to random number.
