Idea on Spectrals:
	[ Done ] Name the bamboozle card to "Tap the Glass" (picture of tyler in art).

Idea on Vouchers:
	
	[ Expand to all decks ] Shop always has 2 vouchers?
		
		If so, first shop of game has special voucher that increases Bamlatro jokers appearance in shop.

Voucher:
	
	[ Done ] Legendary spectral cards are 2X/4X more likely to appear (The Soul, Black Hole).

	[ Done ] ARC RAIDERS FREE LOADOUT: Sells all jokers. Spawn 2/3 common jokers. 2 random conumables. 4 random enhanced playing cards. 0$.





Seal:

	[ Done ] When this card is scored, 1 in 6 chance to add a copy of this card to your deck.

Joker:
	[ Done ] Whenever you use a planet card in-round, destroy up to two selected cards in hand.

	[ Done ] OP DOWN MID: For every hand above 1, increase hand size by that amount. Play only 1 hand.

	[ Done ] When you play a 4 or a 5 of a kind, gain an Emperor.

	[ DONE ] TINKERS CONSTRUCT: Gold cards give 1.25x mult when in hand. Steel cards give $2 when in hand.

	[ Done ] While holding this card, gain 2 joker slots. 0.5X mult. (maybe money drawback instead?)	

	[ Done ] PROP HUNT: When numbered cards are scored, 1 in 2 chance to convert to Jack. When Jacks are scored, 1 in 2 chance to convert to random number.

	[ Done ] GANG BEAST/CRASH OUT: Played cards are debuffed. Retrigger all other jokers (via blueprint-like effects). Legendary?

	[ Done ] After a stone card is scored, break it and add 1/2 regular playing cards to deck.

	[ Done ] ROCK SLIDE: Each stone card played in hand gives +5 mult per stone card in hand.

	[ ] PAY IT FORWARD: Can go up to -$15 in debt. Whenever you go further into debt, a random card in deck gains a gold seal

	Add stone cards somehow?
